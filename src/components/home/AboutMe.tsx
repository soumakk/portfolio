						My web development journey began in college during the PHP era, starting
						with HTML, CSS, and jQuery before diving deep into JavaScript and the React
						ecosystem. After mastering React, I expanded into Node.js through freelance
						work, which taught me valuable client collaboration skills.
					</p>

					<p>
						This foundation led to my first company role working with React and
						TypeScript on diverse projects, where I also developed a strong
						understanding of UI/UX design. I learned to bridge the gap between beautiful
						interfaces and seamless functionality.
					</p>

					<p>
						Today, I&apos;m constantly evolving â€“ exploring AI tools to enhance my
						development workflow and experimenting with WebGL to create interactive 3D
						web experiences. Check out my projects and blog where I share insights from
						my development journey.
