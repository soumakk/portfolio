					My web development journey began in college during the PHP era, starting with HTML, CSS, and jQuery before diving deep into JavaScript and
					the React ecosystem. After mastering React, I expanded into Node.js through freelance work, which taught me valuable client collaboration
					skills.
				</p>

				<p>
					This foundation led to my first company working with React and TypeScript on diverse projects, where I also developed a strong understanding
					of UI/UX design. I learned to bridge the gap between beautiful interfaces and seamless functionality.

					Today, I&apos;m constantly evolving â€“ exploring AI tools to enhance my development workflow and experimenting with WebGL to create
					interactive 3D web experiences. Check out my projects and blog where I share insights from my development journey.
