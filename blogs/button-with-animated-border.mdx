Recently we saw a lot of this trending buttons. They have a border that is moving through the border line of the button.

So first of all lets create the button

```html
<button class="animated-btn">Register now</button>
```

Okay now we will create a basic button

```css
.animated-btn {
	background: #151515;
	border: 1px solid transparent;
	border-radius: 999px;
	padding: 12px 24px;
	color: #ffffff;
	font-size: 14px;
	cursor: pointer;
}
```

Okay now we have a basic button. We need to understand how conic gradient works. Conic gradient is also one type of gradient along with linear and radial gradient. It creates a gradient with color transitions rotated around a centre point.

```css
.animated-btn {
	background: conic-gradient(red, orange, yellow, green, blue);
}
```
